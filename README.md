# track-visualizer

This spotify API based track-visualizer will show you oscilloscopes, frequency bars and lyric based word clouds, all based on the songs in your Spotify playlists.

The oscilloscopes and frequency bars will be drawn using the audio analyzed through webAudio and getDisplayMedia. The lyrics are fetched from the musixmatch API and will be used to generate a word cloud using anychart.

A video demonstrating the application is available here: https://youtu.be/5yQ2B3-fI7M
